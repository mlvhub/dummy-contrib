This project is the "contrib", meaning it's a set of libraries used by services. It showcases how to have multiple modules in a single repository with module-specific versioning.

The tags must follow the path of where the module is as detailed in [this official doc](https://go.dev/doc/modules/managing-source#multiple-module-source).
